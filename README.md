# JUST ONE

My implementation of Just One, a German word based card game.
This "game" basically is just showing random words.
You can find more information about this game [here](https://asmodee.de/just-one).

## Generating Word List

1. Take images of all cards. I photographed 16 cards at once, layed out in a 4 by 4 grid
2. Put them into the folder `wordlist/images`
3. Install the Python dependencies in `wordlist/requirements.txt`
4. Go into the `wordlist` folder and run `python3 generate_wordlist.py`
5. Go through the generated list `wordlist.txt` and correct any wrong words. You can also add new words or modify them in the file, if you want
